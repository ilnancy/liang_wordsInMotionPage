# DES228: Words In Motion Project
#### Arpil 8, 2024

## Project Overview
The project I chose is the song called: "What Was I Made For?" by Billie Eilish.
This song represents the community of womanhood. It symbolizes the struggles and challenges of finding who you are. The lyrics that are chosen are the ones that I want to emphasize.

This relates to me because I too had many times having difficulties in self-doubt, exploring my identity, pleasing others, not putting myself first, not knowing how to feel or deal with my emotions. This project showcases what I want to portray and what community means to me.
