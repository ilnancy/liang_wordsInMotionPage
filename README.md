## Project Overview
This song represents the community of womanhood. It symbolizes the struggles and challenges of finding who you are. This relates to me because I too had many times having difficulties in self-doubt, exploring my identity, pleasing others, not putting myself first, not knowing how to feel or deal with my emotions.
