## Project Overview
The project I chose is the song called: "What Was I Made For?" by Billie Eilish.

This song represents the community of womanhood. It symbolizes the struggles and challenges of finding who you are. To me, it represents the community of womanhood because it brings woman together in their experiences and that they are not alone in feeling whatever they want to express. 

After hearing this song for the first time, it explained how I wanted to express how I was feeling and have been going through. The verses that are chosen are the ones that I want to emphasize. For example, the verse "Someday, I might" is very important because whenever I have trouble on how to feel at that moment, I eventually know in the future and that's completely valid. These emotions might not be solved right away and that's why it's crucial to take your time to process. 

Other things that relates to me in this song is I too had many times having difficulties in self-doubt, exploring my identity, pleasing others, and not putting myself first. 

This project showcases what I want to portray and what community means to me.
